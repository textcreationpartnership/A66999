            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>SIR, you have occasioned the putting this question. And now as it is our duty, so is it our businesse to put this out of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <q>That a Godly Minister ought, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107212:3"/> the truth of Christ unto his hearers, that he may, through him that strengthneth, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish them therein; so also to fence and guard them against all that which is as the remorest extreams are, cleave crosse and contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</q> And truly, Sir (to make bold with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answer to Mr. Bl. p.</hi> 394.</note> that learned mans words, in a matter somewhat different.) <hi>But that the interest of mens immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, is come to be concerned herein, we should think the time exceedingly lavish'd that will be spent in this enquiry. Let him that is ignorant (about this his duty) let him be ignorant still, were a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient answer thereunto.</hi> Yet considering that great <hi>interest</hi> aforesaid, we will give you our perswasion in this matter, and leave it to the Godly-wise to judge, how consonant it is with the holy Scriptures. Your judgement, as is too evident, bends the contrary way; you would have drunkennesse, and such like prophanesses, and ranting doings, declaimed against in the Pulpit, as also abhominable Idolatries, and damnable Heresies, not forgetting that <hi>cursed toleration‚Äî</hi>&amp;c. Truly Sir, we can speak clearly, our Consciences bearing us witnesse in the Lord, that we hate, yea, loath such doings, with those Idolatries and Heresies (not to make comparison) with our hearts and spirits: only for that <hi>Toleration</hi> so much Anathematized, we are not so clear about it as we ought to be, before we curse it <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Clear light is needfull for men who walk in paths which lead directly to houses of blood, Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>of Tol. p.</hi> 40.</note>: only this is clear unto us by the Spirit of God in his word, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> and <hi>thy labour,</hi> and <hi>thy patience,</hi> and how <hi>thou canst not bear them</hi> which are <hi>evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107212:3"/>
               <p> Now how far our Rulers are to be faulted herein, is not for us to judge. So let that pass without our curse, till we know more certainly of it; yet we hope we shal be found in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those that <hi>cannot bear with that which is evil in</hi> our selves, or in others, so far as may lie within our compasse to hinder. And this last said layeth (as we conceive) a charge upon us, to deal with you here, as we have done in those sacred matters hitherto, plainly and clearly; and this is it we would say first.</p>
               <p>That we cannot think that drunkennesse, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse, those ranting doings there, and here, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">¬ß. </seg>1</label> and every where, no nor those abhominable <hi>ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,</hi> nor those <hi>damnable Heresies,</hi> do procure such mischief to the Church of Christ, as your doings do in the house of God (if we may call your meeting places by that name) <hi>Your free admission of all Infants to the Font, and of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the Lords Table, so be they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into your National Church.</hi> It is our perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that these your doings (you being in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as we hope you are, a Godly man) <hi>do the Church of Christ the greatest mischief, together with the toleration of an Heathenish feast, you call the Feast of the Blessed Nativity;</hi> and the profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also, you your self helping it on, of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> these are the doings which do mischief the Church of Christ very much, at the least have a tendancy that way; for we know, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief it these cannot: Because, <hi>he that watereth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Is.</hi> 27. 3.</note>
                  <hi>it every moment,</hi> being his <hi>Vineyard of Red-wine,</hi> will see to it, lest <hi>any hurt it, keeping it night and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107212:4"/> day:</hi> On this very day, though a day of trouble and of rebuke, and of provocation; the onely wise God is working gloriously for his Church, and making a blessed method of all these confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; he will give unto his people <hi>an expected end, Peace, Peace,</hi> to all those whose hearts are staid upon him, because they trust in him. So <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 3.</note> that we have concluded from Scripture promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>That the Church of Christ could not have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any of your doings, either at the Font, or at the Lords Table:</hi> He that spake light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, brought life out of the Grave, a most glorious Blessing, from a most cursed Crosse, will (his people can trust him) bring glory to his great name, and good to his Churches, by all the evil of your doings before mentioned, and yet not yours more then theirs who are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in office with you, all over your National Church, doing the same things, rather the same provocations. But no thanks to you for all this, no more then we can give to them who have done, and to this day do their utmost to undo us; your doings have a tendency the other way, to set things back, or to turn them to the posture they were in; to hinder that <hi>imperious reformation, which will not leave an hoof behind in Aegypt;</hi> your doings are a meer provocation to God (we are plain with you Sir, and we must be so, but for your good, if you can see it) a meer provocation we said; ye provoke your God more then the Drunkards do, then hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical mockers do; more then prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as was <hi>Esau,</hi> yea more then the Ranters
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107212:4"/> do; or those abhominable Idolaters, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereticks, those they call Quakers; ye provoke your God more then do any of these, or all these. Sir, for love-sake, we would call somethings to your remembrance: The Lord God did not take it so ill, it was not full up to the height of such a provocation, that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines <hi>carted his Ark,</hi> they did like Philistines that had no light nor rule to walk by, so up they hoisted the Ark, and no breach upon them for so doing: <hi>Israel</hi> doth so too, and we al know what <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19 <hi>Num.</hi> 45. 20.</note> followed, <hi>Uzzah</hi> is smitten dead, performing as he thought a service of love unto it, which speaks out plainly, and like Thunder in our ears, that the Lord God will take that from a <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 7. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 13.</note> which he will not take from an <hi>Israelite;</hi> from an <hi>Infidel,</hi> which he will not take from a <note place="margin">A parvum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus &amp; mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum est in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilibus in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris nihil non maximum.

The Lord God may bear with these a long
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107212:5"/> time after his manner, as he did with the Amo rites; yet when (take it by the way) he begins to strike, he will make an end, there shall not need a second blovv: But vve find not he did ever bear so long vvith his ovvn people in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vvith him. Therefore surely those vvords contain much, and teacheth us a great lesson. <hi>Beware of him and obey</hi> this <hi>voice, provoke him not,</hi>

                  <hi>of compassion forgave their iniquity.</hi> Surely, this cannot be meant of a true and proper pardon of sin; but onely thus, upon their feigned repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and humiliation for sin, the Lord respited their judgement; he did not punish them at that time, so the follovving vvords are <hi>exegeticall,</hi> they explain the former, <hi>He forgave their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and destroyed them not, yea many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</hi> But these vvords in <hi>Exodus, He will not pardon your transgressions,</hi> speaks forth this, as vve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and it is very observable, he vvill not vvink at his Churches sins; no, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self vvill not, and for many reasons, too long here to set dovvn; yet, take this one amongst many, sith it is to our purpose, he so loved his people that he gave himself for them, and vvash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">

               <p>The sum of what we would say thereunto is this, that the prophanesse of you the Prophets and Stewards in Gods house, which <hi>from you is gone forth into all the land,</hi> is rather to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Pulpit, then any of the forementioned, for the reason above said, because those sinners do not so much hurt without Gods house-(un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you admit them in) as your prophanesse doth within Gods house, being more conragious then a Plague-sore there.

God will indure ten times as much from another, a prophane person him, or her, then he will from whom he loves, and hath taken into covenant with himself. And as the Lord is sooner provoked to anger by the sins of his own children, then of any other men, so his anger wont to be hotter, and his correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sharper on them then on any other.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Lord saw it, saith Moses</hi> (that his <note place="margin">

And this be spoken, for the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, who will never cease, till they cease to speak in the Pulpit, to declame against those abhominations that are comitted in Gods house, and more especially at the Lords Table, more against these then against all the Swinish Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and Divellish Ranters in the Nation, or Church National. For to speak out once more, we cannot be inclined to think, that the Swinish Drunkard, that jeerer and scorner of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that abhominable Idolater, who <hi>derideth</hi> the words of Christ, as once they did that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous person, we cannot think that any one of these, or all these do so much mischief in the

And now we have spoken plainly and proceed so to speak, that we may in the first place prevent if it may be, what is suggested, against this plain dealing in the Pulpit, wherein we have cause to fear our Minister hath not dealt so fully and plainly with his people (whatever is sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted or forced to the contrary, that he is too plain) as he is charged from his God, and hath his Warrant from his Scriptures so to be.</p>

We have thought heartily of excellent <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> Letters, which speaks fully to this matter: But we made some mention of it before. That worthy man in his Exposition upon <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 5. speaks yet more fully to this, how to know our season for silence, and for speech, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us very much to take notice of, because we know in some cases, it is our wisedom to be silent, and in some cases, it is our folly not to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107212:7"/> speak. Wee will onely borrow that learned mans general, <hi>It is our season to speak, when by speaking we may bring glory to God, and do good to our brethren.</hi> Then a Minister of Christ <hi>must</hi> speak, if there be a <hi>Must,</hi> to do his duty, come on it what will. Be the time never so perillous, hard and sierce, yet when he may bring glory to God, and good to his Brethren, then the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man will not keep silence, though it is an evil time. Nay he cannot keep silence, though he would, for so would his flesh, it would be spared; but keep silence he cannot, <hi>His love to Christ constrains him,</hi> Christs love to him, his <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> love to Christ, is like fire within him, it will flame forth, together with his anger against all that, which is contrary to the mind and will of his Lord and Christ; so now in this case, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 13.</note> the glory of Christ is concerned, you may sirname him as one was the <hi>Zelot;</hi> for of those two affections <hi>love</hi> and <hi>anger, Zeal</hi> is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Anger is as much out of love, as hatred;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ira est tam ex amore, quam ex odio</note> a true rule though it may seem a Paradox; he that loves Christ dearly (else he loves him not) is carried out angerly, yea hatefully against that which his Lord hateth, whether in himself (this hatred begins within) or in other persons or things; for it hinders <hi>union</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with the person he so dearly loves. This mans zeal is for Christ, who was so zealous for him, as that to accomplish his peace, he was content and chose rather to suffer the pangs of Hell, whence it is that the faithfull of the Lord have appeared for him in the most perilous times, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107212:7"/> have not been able to hold in and conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though they might have saved their lives and escaped terrible tormentings, by <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the truth in unrighteousness,</hi> would the Christians in the Primitive times, have offered a <hi>grain</hi> onely to the cursed Idol, or have suffred it to be said <hi>they had offered,</hi> when they had not? what dreadfull sufferings had they prevented!

               <p>We proceed to tell you our persvvasion, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">¬ß </seg>3</label> a Minister of Christ cannot keep silence, at this time, though it be <hi>an evil time,</hi> but the rather lift up his voice like a Trumpet; and against those things vvherein you vvould persvvade, if not command silence; surely the charge of God unto him, and the Word of his God vvithin him, is like <hi>fire</hi> there, or like <hi>new Wine,</hi> it must have a vent. He hath the <hi>mind of Christ,</hi> as all the faithfull before him; and as they have done in the cause of Christ, and matters of his service, so must he.

                  <hi>why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the Crosse ceased.</hi> It is a full Scripture, and <hi>Luther</hi> hath a full Exposition upon it; but we passe on, yet cannot we forbear to tell you: Sir, by the way, our Godly jealousie of you, that you are not so resolute in the cause of Christ, to say no more, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and all the faithfull of God ought to be, and assuredly are, if they are indeed what they professe to be; and the reason of our jealousie is, because you are so quiet among your neighbours, and they so qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et with you; it is much feared you never storm their Idols; for when you shall so do, past all peradventures they will storm you, though you carry your matters never so wisely. It is well you do, if so you do: The <hi>wisedom</hi> of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> is allowed you, to be prudent and discreet <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 16.</note> in the management of your affairs; but you do
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107212:9"/> remember you must be <hi>as harmless as a Dove; Study to be quiet</hi> is the Apostles counsel, and it is to be followed by you, though ye should be as a Sheep in the midst of Wolves. And in the midst of them every faithfull Minister is at this day, as the faithfull before him were in former daies; and the more he shall declare his <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> the more his people will declare their <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness.</hi> And surely, Sir, you fare not better then your Brethren; you are in the midst of Wolves too, however they may look like Sheep, presenting their Infants to Baptism, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a moneth after to the Lords Table; for then <hi>they are in Sheeps cloathing, when inwardly they are ravening Wolves.</hi> Ye have by your so free admission dressed them up like sheep, and they have for a day changed their actions, but their <hi>natures</hi> are the same, and as very Wolves as they were before, and more grievous (which may be, and cannot possibly but be so) ever since they had admittance to that place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto onely Sheep and Lambs should be allowed to come, we mean true Disciples. And now it is easily understood how it comes to passe, that you live so quietly in the midst of these (though Wolves they are, as sure as <hi>Nero</hi> was a Lion, and <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox, unlesse ye have made them sheep at the Lords Table; that is, have converted them there, for that is possible, say you) it is because you reckon all Sheep, and none Wolves, Dogs and Swine in your Parish, and continue such till by the Word and Spirit our nature bee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107212:9"/> changed as well as our actions: But yet this we were saying, this is the way to be taken, and it is an easie way to be found, being a beaten path, and the <hi>road</hi> of the National Church, to live quietly amidst your people, and they quietly with you; <hi>account them all Sheep, and admit them all to the Lords Table, upon that account, because they can shew for it, they were born and baptized within the Pale of a Church-National.</hi> We have told you our jealousie and so will proceed, but we are clearly of your brother <hi>Humphrey's</hi> mind, and others of your Brethren of the same perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and practise with you, how that <hi>there will not be any difference betwixt you and your people.</hi> But when you shall <hi>fetch a full blow</hi> (it is <hi>Luther's</hi> expression) at your Disciples and Saints, who hold their Saint-ship by no other <hi>tenure,</hi> but that of <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> then you shall hear them <hi>rage</hi> and roar, as their <hi>Father</hi> will when hee is <hi>pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. There will not be any difference betwixt you and your people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we take in what you plead <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>It is well you do, and yet to be plain with you, we make some doubt thereof. It is a necessary truth, and in the first place to be declared unto us, what creatures we are by our <hi>first birth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born children of wrath, and bringing in with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107212:10"/> us a most fruitfull root which puts forth (if by one member onely, then how much more by all) <hi>a world of iniquity.</hi> This must be declared unto us, and in some measure understood by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 3. 6.</note> ever we will look after Christ, or attend the means whereby he is made known unto us, or can be received by us. <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>He that would make the way plain for Christ, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the true sense of the depth, breadth, and length of original sin. We must be told there is no more in us by nature then in Divels, why we should be justified, Mr.</hi> B. <hi>of</hi> Just. <hi>p.</hi> 183. <hi>To bee born lame, blind, or deformed, is judged an heavy calamity: But to come into the World an enemy to God, and God an enemy to us, is not at all regarded.</hi>
                  </note> Now you, that teach your people to account so highly of their birth-priviledge, as that they are born Believers, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, Saints, being baptized into your Church; ye cannot (as we conceive) hold our before them, as you ought, <hi>that horrid state of nature,</hi> as worthy <hi>Shepheard</hi> calls it, wherein every mothers child is born.</p>
               <p>Truly Sir, we are more then jealous of you, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sinfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises are but expositions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our natures, Mr.</hi> W.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Temp.</hi> 38.</note>
                  <hi>sin that original sin would not draw and entice a man unto, there being no sin that is committed, but</hi>

                     <hi>p.</hi> 68.</note>
                  <hi>meer favour alone, who hath kept us and our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, from occasions of such sins, or such occasions from us.</hi> Blesse God then (worthy <hi>Capel</hi> speaks still, and did you ever hear words more pat to our purpose, and more full to give instruction and to call to remembrance as some Psalms are titled.) <hi>Bless God then that</hi> Cain <hi>hath not killed</hi> Abel <hi>in our houses; that</hi> Amnon <hi>hath not deslow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our</hi> Tamar; <hi>that our</hi> Absolom <hi>hath not been the death of his brother</hi> Amnon; <hi>aye, that our son</hi> Absolom <hi>hath not sought our lives also; that</hi> Reuben <hi>hath not gone up to his fathers Couch. What are we? what are our fathers houses, that we have been preserved in our houses from such scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sins? Are we better? are we so good as these fathers were? Should God sit still, and the Law of Nature look on, and let our original sin or lust within shew it self? The next would be sin upon sin, against Scripture, against nature, no bonds, no bounds would hold us from growing worse and worse still, with greatest violence wee should long after the greatest sins, and the end would be a Reprobate sense; from the which, Good Lord deliver us.</hi> It may be of use to look over these words again, as we all, so you with your brethren, above many, have need of them. You cannot make us believe that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107212:11"/> you have preached to your people all necessary truths; ye have if not clean omitted, yet ye have slurred over this one so necessary a truth before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, what cursed creatures we are in the state of nature? Give us leave to say, what you should say to your people, but they abhor to hear it, and then would abhor you for speaking it; what grievous Wolves, mad Doggs, filthy Swine they are by Nature; they are in every mire of sin, or would be there. Ye have slurred over this sure, what beasts we are? how stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked? Iron-sinewed? <hi>self-willed</hi> (all laws in one) how willfull we are? All which might be proved to us, and fully argued from <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 6. ver. 16. and last words, <hi>but they said we will not walk therein;</hi> you, and we remember it Sir, the place where, and time when those words were passed over; we doubted lest they should be as goads in our sides to awaken us out of our dead sleep‚ÄîBut to go on, ye have to speak in the Lords own words, <hi>healed this our hurt slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Ye have bid your people glory in their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledge (as ye and they call it) for thereby they are instated in, and possessed of as soon as they are born all Church-administrations, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants priviledge for Baptism; the Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Dogs and Swine, though they are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the Lords Table.

This relating to our purpose and instruction, we will give you the exposition thereof, as it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us. <hi>God is onely wise, onely strong, how then speaks the Apostle of the foolishnesse or weakness of God? His meaning is, look what act soever of God appears to man as having foolishness or weakness in it, even that foolishness is wiser, and that weakness stronger then men. The foolishness of God is Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the weaknesse of God is strength, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God is light; for as God is strength, and in him there is no weaknesse at all; light, and in him there is no darknesse at all; so God is wisedom, and in him there is no foolishnesse at all; It is but mans foolish heart that thinks so.) But let him think this with it, the foolishnesse of God is wiser then men, and if the wisedom of men cannot match with the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness of God, how shall it contend with the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107212:14"/> of God?</hi> If you can receive this, receive it, and much use may you make of it, as the Godly Ministers do, doing their duty, though charged with foolishnesse for so doing, so was their Lord and Master before them.</p>

And here
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107212:14"/> not knowing who the Reader may be, we would inform him in one thing; That the Lord Christ did not, nor did his Disciples eat with <hi>defiled</hi> hands as the word is rendred, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 2. that is with <hi>common</hi> or <hi>unclean hands.</hi> They did observe even in those matters, decency and order.

Thus they did, and they put Religion in it, in washing the outside onely, and none in this, none at all (the manner of men in those days, and so up to our days, and will be their manner till the great day, when daies shall be no more, but all daies swallowed up in that eternal day or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting night) we were saying, no religion at all do they put; <hi>in cleansing their hands, and purifying their hearts, that so they may draw nigh God, and he draw nigh to them.</hi> But observe we with all observation, how the Lord contesteth against them in this thing. And let all the faithfull of God learn their duty here from the example of their Lord, to contend against lying vanities, and superstitious observations till they die, Come on it what will, they have their warrant sealed unto them, even from their Lord and great Master himself, and his very practise here, from which we shall now come off and proceed.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">¬ß </seg>4</label> not the personating of men in the Pulpit; nor we neither, unlesse it be so done that a Minister hath a sure word from his God so to do, and so orders the matter, that his fin shal personate or point out the guilty man, and not his name; though why his name should be concealed, when his sin is publick and notorious, we know not, and are yet to seek. But this we know, the faithful servants of Christ in al ages of the World, have, according to the word and example of Christ, reproved sinners to their faces, dealing particularly with them, <hi>thou art the man, ye are the men: And indeed, when men are ascended some degrees above Hypocrisie, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and shamelesnesse in sinning, why should the servant of Christ be shame-faced in reproving?

               <p n="1">1. Let us observe the manner of <hi>John Baptist;</hi> first, and how roundly he deals with the best and <label type="milestone">

               <head>CHAP. IIII.</head>
               <p>ANd now we take leave, after our manner, to set down our Arguments, whereby to prove, that it is the duty of every Godly Minister, to treat with his people, about those matters fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, <hi>Admission of all to the Sealing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, observation of Christmas,</hi> for we speak as we may be understood, and <hi>the saying the Lords Prayer;</hi> and to make clear proof unto them: That these things ought not to be done, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are done all over the National Church, being a meer provocation of wrath, a fire that burneth all the day.</p>
               <p>First, then we argue it thus, that which the Lord God hateth, all the Godly Ministers and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">¬ß </seg>1</label> people do hate also, else they are not Godly; <hi>do I not hate them, O Lord, that hate thee,</hi> them that professedly, openly, and in some eminent way of opposition set themselves against God and godliness, <hi>do I not hate them Lord, that hate thee?</hi> certainly, the Godly throughout the World, are made so like their God now, having received his spirit with the word, holy, as he is holy, that what their God hates, they hate, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred they hate it, and what he loves they love. God hath placed affections in the soul, that we may imbrace good things and welcom them, with love, joy, and delight, and avoid evil things with indignation, hatred, and soul-loathing.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107212:21"/> Now sit we down and bethink our selves what doth the Lord hate more, then he doth those presumptuous doings at the place, where the <hi>Font,</hi> as commonly we call it, standeth, and that other place, where is the Lords-Table?</p>
               <p>First, We shall need to adde but little to this, in the first place having spoken so much to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Surely, you will grant, that that high and mighty person (such he was by his place) you read of in the Church Chronicles, dealt hatefully, rather depitefully with God and good men, when he did at the Communion-Table, what he should have done without dores, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wall. * Sir, look to it now whether <note place="margin">Julian Uncle to Julian the Apostate, but memorable was the revenging hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vented it self not by the accustoned pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, but through his mouth, and so he died.</note> you (of Mr. <hi>Hs.</hi> perswasion and practise) may not do as hatefully with your Lord Christ, whom you profess to know, to love, and to fear, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his enemies and adversaries to his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? taking no other account from them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were baptized in that large and wide Church, the Nation there? These were hateful doings sure (we will remember you once more of <hi>Calvins</hi> words) <hi>To take the sacred body of Christ, and cast it to Dogs by them to be rent and torn in pieces; but so hatefully do these Ministers deal with his sacred body, that give the Signs and Seals of it to Dogs and Swine.</hi> We pass from that, onely remember the point we are making out, the Godly Minister hateth what his heavenly father hateth, therefore cannot but contend against such hateful doings.</p>
               <p>Think you, Sir, which of the two abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107212:21"/> rise highest: the horrible prophanation of the Lords day, or the celebration of Christmas day? And judge your self about it whether you can give the least countenance to it; or do not withall your might and main contest against it: Surely so you must do, else you do not as the Godly do, <hi>hate that which their Lord hateth.</hi> You will find it an hard work to take off your people from that annual observation, as it is, to take of a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Papist</hi> from his Religion; yet if you will approve your self a Godly man, and so to <hi>hate what God hates,</hi> you must set about it; for untill they shall draw off their observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from that day, they can never be drawn on to the observation of the Lords day; the one or the other will be an abhomination to them, we passe that also.</p>
               <p>In the next place think you here also whether the <hi>dreadfull Name of God</hi> is not fearfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned <note place="margin">‚Ä† 3.</note> every day by the wicked man? saying the Lords Prayer; we know not how often in the week daies (for commonly he can say no other Prayer) but so often as he comes to the meeting place, there he says it, but how doth he blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his God in so saying it? Truly we could hope, that if you would speak to your hearers in <hi>Isidorus</hi> words, about their saying this Prayer and not call them what they are not, <hi>Believers, Disciples, and Saints,</hi> but what they are, till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the spirit of their minds, <hi>Wolves, Swine, Dogs,</hi> which is said of all ungodly men at once, <hi>without are Dogs, Revel.</hi> 22. 15. we were saying,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107212:22"/> it might be hoped they would as soon let Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire into their mouth, as let this prayer go out of their lips. Though yet we remember a wicked man is a very bold man and presumptuous; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at this point of <hi>praying the Lords Prayer:</hi> A <hi>fool rageth</hi> (that is sinneth outragiously) yet is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 16.</note> he <hi>confident. Isidorus</hi> words are these, as we have heard them Englished unto us, and as you <note place="margin">

                  <hi>whole will, all his glory, the cause and end of what he doth, or the principle from whence, with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive wherefore he doth it]</hi> this <hi>name,</hi> saith he, <hi>be Hallowed?</hi> But how doth he blaspheme it, being the first born of Satans children, the chiefest of the black guard belonging to the King of the bottomless pit? That worthy man goes on, shewing the blasphemy of this wicked man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Thy Kingdome come, thy will be done,</hi> whereas <hi>his father the wicked one himself is not a more deadly enemy to the comming of the one, and doing of the other, then this wicked person is, he or her.</hi> There is much more which is commended to your private reading, and as was said, please you, to your translating, that so your people may understand it, so you may do them good, whereas he saying the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107212:22"/> before them, which they will repeat after you, You do them infinite hurt, for you make them <hi>hlaspheme,</hi> which every Godly Minister hateth to do, because his heavenly father hateth it, that is first.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we argue it from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">¬ß </seg>2</label> of Gods vengeance executed upon Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that have by their more then connivance, suffered the Throne of his glory to be prophaned in those places by free admission to all commers; <hi>My flesh trembleth because of thee, and I fear for thy</hi>

                     <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 6.</note> God would inflict a greater darknesse upon them the Prophets in his just judgement, then upon the people, <hi>Those that abuse most light, they come into most grosse darkness:</hi> The <hi>Seers</hi> especially, they should be blind, who would see visions of peace for them against whom the Lord threatens War: <hi>The night shall be upon the Prophets, their</hi>

                  <hi>Arm shall be clean dried up, and their right eye ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly darkned.</hi> They are smitten in the Crown of a man, the understanding they abused it, they perverted it, therefore the Lord <hi>cursed his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</hi> And behold them now, they are besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107212:23"/> in their very parts and abilities. It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Burroughs</hi> observation, <hi>There is more dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse upon wicked Ministers this day amongst us then upon ordinary people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What should be the reason of this, the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or meritorious cause of it? Surely, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations they have committed, or suffered to be committed in Gods-house, where they professe themselves to be set as Watch-men, and as Stewards, having the charge of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, to give every one their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in due season, and they have been more slight and carelesse here in admitting filty and noisom ones into his house, which they durst not do being Stewards to an earthly Lord; nay, which they would do in their own house, which you know was <hi>Calvin's</hi> complaint long ago, whereof anon after, which made him foretel what he did fore-see, terrible wrath comming upon the Christian world, and behold it is come.</p>
               <p>And great is the wrath that is powred down upon the people too, they were permitted to communicate at the Lords-Table, before they were prepared for it by the word Preached to discern of the Lords-body, and now they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to their own lusts, and being <hi>past feeling commit sin with greedinesse,</hi> and sitting under the dropping of the word, they are stirred no more then a Mill-post; Now the Lords Day is sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, and Mans day honoured. The Lords Prayer as ordinarily blasphemed as his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107212:23"/> Name; O the terrible wrath that hath pursued, and hath overtaken Ministers and people, people presuming to come, whether they had no more call to come, then a Swine hath to come to your Closet, and Ministers consenting that they should come, having no more warrant from their Lord for it, then they have to suffer a man to stab himself, with the sword they could take out of his hands; knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, and that because of these things the <hi>wrath of God is come upon the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> A godly Minister cannot but perswade Ministers and people by the <hi>terrour of the Lord,</hi> and intreat them by the mercies of Christ to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider well what is done, or what they suffer to be done in Gods house, as to these sacred admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations there, and other horrible prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which alwaies follow the prophaning of these sacred things, as the thread followeth the needle.</p>
               <p>And if there be such a destruction to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">¬ß </seg>3</label> (the wicked Minister especially) so strange a punishment to the workers of iniquity, <hi>as is the sword upon their arm</hi> (of Ministers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>and upon their right eye then how can it be, but the destruction from God,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, must be <hi>a terrour to a godly Minister,</hi> that he may not by <hi>connivance</hi> or <hi>silence,</hi> which is a consenting be an occasion to draw down this destruction upon the people. The destruction upon another, which yet he hath drawn upon himself, <hi>with both hands</hi> and as with <hi>cart-ropes,</hi> is terrible to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107212:24"/> or stander by, how much more terrible to a Minister, when he shall consider, that he hath (to speak in a word) by his <hi>dawbing</hi> occasioned that destruction? he never told his people, and fore-warned them of the destruction, which would follow their prophaning of holy things, as to our ear the Thunder clap, the lightning, they were suffered to do it, and they did it, and <hi>their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister restrained them not,</hi> he <hi>wrinkled</hi> not his <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.</note> fore-head upon them, he <hi>frowned</hi> not. <hi>Surely, this is the manner of a godly Minister, while his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are doing him hurt, he will be keeping them what he can from hurt; while they trouble him, he will discover his tendernesse towards them; that if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he may prevent their trouble, which certainly will follow their prophanation of holy things.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me <hi>from blood</hi> (saith <hi>David)</hi> blood-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">

But it is not what the Lord can do, but what he will do, which he hath declared unto us in his word, <hi>who they are that shall profit his people, and who shal not; they who stand in his counsel, and cause his people to hear his words, these shall profit the people.</hi> They who do not so shall <hi>not profit the people at all,</hi> Jerem. 23. 22. 32. we shall set down <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s words upon that Scripture, as we have heard them opened unto us, having such a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to our scope: <hi>It was not the purpose of the Prophet to set down the counsel of God in the several parts and pieces of sound, wholesom, and saving
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107212:26"/> Doctrine; for we have in the Prophets but a brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or abstract of their Sermons, as much as the holy God saw needfull for us, but it sufficed the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to refell or reprove the false Teachers, who yet would be accounted the onely men, though they stood not in Gods counsel, nor caused the people to hear his word, though they had no regard at all to build up the people, but themselves, and to make themselves fat by the sins of the people, that was indeed all their care: So though they saw all things, like the counsel of the froward, carried head-long in a direct way or tendency to utter ruine; yet what cared they? They saw wickedness in its Throne, and impetuously run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as righteousnesse should do, through the land like a Flood, or mighty stream: They saw, and they heard horrible contempts and affronts to God, and which must needs issue from it, as a filthy stream from a more corrupt Fountain, the filthy conve<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Yet their unrighteous soul hearing and seeing all these unlawfull deeds, were rather cheared then vexed,</hi> Caecutibant ad haec omnia, <hi>they were more then Pur-blind, they saw none of all this, nor did they hear it (to reprove it, but rather to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it) for who so blind and deaf as my servant (saith the Lord) that will neither see nor hear.</hi> So far we have read <hi>Calvin,</hi> giving us an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome or Abstract of our times, and what false Teachers do, even as they have done, suffered the people to make themselves vile, and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them not, and so <hi>could not profit the people at all;</hi> and what true and right Ministers ought to do, do their office, stand in <hi>Gods counsel,</hi> cause

Yet this we would speak here, that he groundeth this his <hi>ingenious position</hi> (for we may speak contraries, in this case, as he to the truth) upon this supposition, <hi>that actual receiving is a converting Ordinance:</hi> Or thus, <hi>The Sacrament is not onely food to nourish, but it is, as the word is, an immortal seed to beget to Christ.</hi> It is in vain, say our Godly Ministers, to put bread and wine into a dead mans mouth.

               <p>Now we would refer the Reader for his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at this point, to that, which the Lords four Worthies one after another, have replied to this‚ÄîWe had almost said monstrous conceit, being, as we conceive, as abhorrent to grace, as Monsters are to nature. <hi>That actual

               <p>We humbly conceive, no, and so we give our perswasion, <hi>That those concomitant duties, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the Lords Table, in the time of receiving, have not the stamp or Seal of God upon them for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version work.</hi> These shall effect that for which they were appointed, the strengthning the weak in faith, and increasing of grace already begun, not for the working, or begetting of grace, where it is not. It is true, many speak glorious things, what quicknings they have felt by the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prayers, they have heard at the burial of the dead, and amongst the living at the Lords Table. But we believe they have <hi>erred in their hearts,</hi> and have been wholly deluded in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for most apparent it is, to those that can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their walk: That whatever they say, there is no change wrought upon them thereby; but for the worse, being rendred more obdurate and <hi>seared;</hi> more, if more can be, <hi>earthly seasual,</hi> and <hi>Divellish,</hi> as they must needs be whose wisdom is not from above, and therefore do Idolize the word spoken at those times and places, which they contemn and reproach, spoken to them on the stated day from the Pulpit.

They that never regarded a Sermon all their life long, will have one if they may have their will at the burial of their dead, and they that cast the Pearl of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation at their heel, or under foot, and rent them that bring it, will seem to make an high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it at other times and places; Therefore said that worthy man, <hi>ob eam{que} causam preces, &amp; consciones non esse, in funere adhibendas, quoniam exequiae, &amp; funus ita procurari debent, ut tam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideles, quam fideles, illi inter esse possunt.</hi>

               <p>But holy things are not to be given to Dogs, neither are Pearls to be cast before Swine, such as are known prophane persons, enemies to the Crosse of Christ, deriders of the Word of his grace.</p>
               <p>Hence we would infer for our information, and the Readers if he need any, and to ratifie our perswasion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Believers and Infidels (if any such there be in a National Church, where all are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) who ought to come together for the burial of the dead, ought not to come together in one place, where the signs and seals of Christs body and blood are given forth.</p>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:107212:29"/> 2. We infer, that the admission of prophane ones, deriders and scorners, to hear and see what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and done at the Lords-Table, serveth to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them more, and to build them up in their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious conceits, as do the Prayers and Sermons at the burial of the dead: We are for the most part, as Idolatrous, as were the Jews, and as now the Heathen are, they worshipped with their faces Eastward, so do we now; witnesse the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Chancels, our comming into the Church, the honour we give with our races Eastward, the more Eastward, the more honorable though at the back of the Preacher; the placing the body in the grave witnesseth our superstition also, as doth the placing of the L. Table if it be where it was wont to be, as we believe it is not among Believers; for</p>
               <p n="3">3. We infer in the third place, That what I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters did, and now do, we must not do: But the contrary, as the Lord taught his people Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters worshipped towards the East, his people should worship toward the West; for so he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Temple to be built, the worshippers there should look towards the West, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 16.</p>
               <p>The sum is this, and so we will contract, if we expect Gods blessing, keep we close to the way and means of his own prescribing, <hi>Good ends have straight ways, as holy and pure aims, carrying level therunto.</hi> Look we not as that worthy man saith, <hi>That God wil go out of his ordinary rode-way, to meet</hi>

               <p>We conclude, a godly Minister whose zeal is for God, and the good of his people, will keep close to Gods way, and stand fast in his counsel; he will not expect God should work by means: He never commanded, or ever came it into his heart, not by Prayers and Exhortations at his own Table; He hath not said to our best remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that he wil convert any thereby.

               <p>He cannot well shew himself a truly godly man, and not a truly discreet man; and yet, if he have lesse of the Serpent, and more of the Dove, there will be no lack.

               <p>To this the answer is easie; he is the discreet man, that manageth all his matters full up, in desire and indeavours, to the charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his God; doth his duty and feareth not, <hi>knowing whom he hath trusted, whose he is, and</hi>

He knows full wel this plain dealing cannot be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and therefore cannot be profitable; may be, he knows he shal be persecuted as an enemy for speaking the truth; he looks for it, it must needs be so, so they dealt with his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster before him, and so they will deal with all them that follow their Lord, treading <hi>in his steps.</hi> They are well assured, if their Lord Christ were now amongst us in the fashion of a servant, and in a low condition, as once he was, and should convince men of their wickednesse, as searching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as once he did, he would doubtlesse be the most hated man upon the earth; so must they be who in desire and indeavours do as he did, as to that matter of sharp and cutting reproof. Men may ask what is truth, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, but as he could not, no more can they stay their answer, or <note place="margin">

But a godly man is at a point for that, he seeks not his own profit, but the <hi>profit of many that they may be saved,</hi> and rejoiceth to go through dishonour and evil report for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse sake, and doing his duty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himself in the assurance of approbation from God, and protection from him. The words of the Lord to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107212:37"/> very observable, where he not onely cheareth up the fainting Prophet to his duty, but threatens, if he do it not. <hi>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, speak unto them all that I command thee, be not dismaid at their faces, lest I confound thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them,</hi> Chap. 1. 17. <hi>Lest danger should deter him from speaking to their faces, the Lord sets a greater danger before his face; if he did not speak what he had in commition from his God to speak, lest I confound thee before them.</hi> And so to Ezekiel, <hi>I send thee to a Rebellious Nation that hath rebelled against me, be not afraid of them nor of their words though Bryars and Thorns be with thee, and thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est dwell amongst Scorpions, yet be not afraid of them; but speak my words, and be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house.</hi> The Lord God will <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 3. 7, 8.</note> account that man rebellious, that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and that cuttingly, whom he bids re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Surely God will account no better of those Ministers, but as of rebellious ones, whom he sends out in his name, and Authority to fight against the corruptions of the World; and in the mean time, they shall hang down the head, and be tongue-tied. <q>How ill will God take it when we shall have more boldnesse to destroy our selves, and to do Sathans work, then a Minister of Christ shall have to save us, and to serve his God.</q> We will leave these words upon your thoughts, repeating them once more, <hi>Son of man be not thou rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:107212:38"/> The Almighty God accounts it Rebellion in his Ministers not to do as he commands them to do. Reprove sinners to their faces, and look well to it, speak what I bid you, speak, <hi>lest I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thee before them.</hi>

               <p>Sir, We have been the longer here in evincing a Ministers duty to cry aloud against the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations committed in Gods-house; That we might evidence also our tenderest respects to you and your godly brethren in your way. We are very tender over you, because of the judgement that is written, and is hastning upon you; if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of what is past, and amendment of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cleane out of course for present prevent not: Surely, if we understand any thing of the Lords mind revealed to us in the Scriptures, he will ere long be very severe with you, with you I say Stewards in his house, and in common account faithfull and godly; yea, and so reputed by the godly. He will not indure you long conniving at, yea suffering such abhominable doings in his house.</p>
               <p>The Lord doth not so narrowly observe, what the filth and scummy and sink of the Nation do; we mean what the foolish brutish people do, nor <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 4, 5.</note> what the garbidge or sink of corrupt Ministers do: No, he observes what you do that pass for godly and faithful Stewards. He observes what ye do, and be well aware of it. He will either mend you, or end you, as the saying is. Ye shal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107212:38"/> not be long Stewards in his house, unlesse ye walk more like Stewards there: Think on it we beseech you, and remember the judgements of God, begin at his Sanctuary, for there Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must begin also. And bear with them at the least, who feel the weight or their charge, and must do thereafter, these words of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a terrour to them: <hi>Lest I confound thee before them.</hi>
